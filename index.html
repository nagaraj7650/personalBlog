        Today, i did 2 of my assignments, two left because i ran out of assignment notebooks. Fun for 2-3 weeks from today ig (those who know, know). talked with a friend on vc, happy to see hes enjoying his college. A sparrow came and sat on my left hand for 10s and flew away, but it felt very nice. I wish these sems end fast. Sad, couldnt meet someone.

        I wasnt able to update yesterdays because i dont know. Today was a a good day at C Lab, Humanities is lullaby. Internals from 11th, i really gotta study electronics tomorrow. I thought i would pull a all nighter but i am feeling way too tired, i probably wont even study tomorrow. Anyways, i want to try a redbull tomorrow (for the first time).

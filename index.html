           I thought i would study today, but i did not. Went out with friends, had fun in bowling, the machine was trash. A very motivating evening, thanks. Tomorrow gotta do those assignments or i am dead.

        Today, i did 2 of my assignments, two left because i ran out of assignment notebooks. Fun for 2-3 weeks from today ig (those who know, know). talked with a friend on vc, happy to see hes enjoying his college. A sparrow came and sat on my left hand for 10s and flew away, but it felt very nice. I wish these sems end fast.
